4. Output must be a long-form, full analysis(Final Revised — for blog publishing) — not a short summary.
- Write the report as one single, structured business/financial article in Hindi with clear sections and tables.
- Always include full <html>, <head> with <link rel='stylesheet' href=\"style.css\">, and <body> tags , don't add this ann seary .
- The report may be very long.  split naturally into multiple html files (Part1.html, Part2.html).
- DO NOT mention “Part 1”, “Part 2”, “continuation”, or similar in the html itself. Each part must read as a natural continuation of the previous, without repetition or artificial intros.
- Each chunk should end cleanly (finish a paragraph or table), never in the middle of a sentence.
- When I request “PartX”, output ONLY the content of that portion, continuing seamlessly from the previous, as if writing one long article.
- No instructions, no meta-comments, no reminders — only the report content.

5. Citations: provide inline numbered citations like [1], [2] and include a short reference list at the section end (source name, title, URL, date).  
6. Tone: professional, neutral, business-analytic. Avoid speculative language unless labeled as “अनुमान”.  
7. If any data point cannot be confirmed, write “(अनुमान — आधार: …)”. Flag high-risk assumptions used in projections.  
8. Prefer depth: choose 1 policy and go deep. If using 2, both must be directly comparable with measurable incentives.
9. Nothing  marker.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR PART WORKFLOW:
- When you are first asked to produce Part1, create a polished, self-contained Part1 that could stand alone. Do not mention "I will continue" or produce Part2 content. Wait for the user to request Part2.
- Internally, you may run a web search to gather sources and numbers. Use the most recent official data (prefer sources with dates).
